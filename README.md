The Expense Tracker Project is designed to help users manage their personal finances by tracking their spending habits. It allows users to easily add, edit, and delete expense entries while categorizing them for better organization. With support for multiple user profiles, the app ensures that each user's financial data remains separate. By automatically calculating the total expenses, it provides valuable insights for better budgeting and financial awareness.
